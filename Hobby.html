            <p style="font-family: Lucida; font-size: 15px;">Cooking was one of my way for leisure-time activity. 
                I loved the smile and people's faces when they taste my cake or food, and it gave me a strong push to come up with something better. 
                Each time I make something, I feel a spark of joy in me. It felt like relaxing yet exciting to make something.
                Other than that, I also enjoy to play violin and decided to commit my self to practice more. 
                Sometimes when I am in my mood, I did exercises until my fingertips turn purple as a result of pressing the violin strings for too long. 
                However, I enjoyed and feel satisfied from the result of the hard work.</p>
