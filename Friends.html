                s shown from picture above, this is my best friends. We are a group consisted of 12 people.
                Unfortunately many of them are couldn't attend this catch up sessions :( 
                We've all been friends more or less since we were in Junior High School. 
                Sometimes even though there are differences on opinion, we still respect each other and maintain our friendship.
                I am blessed to have them as my friends.
