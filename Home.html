            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Teodora Lesmana. <br/>
                I am currently a second semester student, studying Informatics at Multimedia Nusantara University. <br/>
                I was born in Bandar Lampung, September 13th 2003. I will be 19 this year, and I am the oldest out of 2. 
                I have a younger brother and he's currently studying on his 2nd year of senior high in Bandar Lampung. <br/>
                <br/> 
                Also, I am really excited to be in a new city later, as well as in a new university. This is a new chapter of my life. 
                Being wander about my hometown even though it's not that far, just scare me a bit actually.
                I look ahead to making new friends, learning new skills, having fun and enjoying my university life.</p>
